# CooperBench Dataset

This dataset contains the benchmark tasks for evaluating multi-agent coordination in code collaboration.

**Run it with the official harness:** [github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench](https://github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench) (`pip install cooperbench`, then `cooperbench prepare` downloads this dataset). The harness, the Docker images, and this dataset are versioned together — use the GitHub repo's `dataset/` tree or this mirror at the matching tag.

- **Paper**: [CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13295)
- **Code**: [github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench](https://github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench)
- **Website**: [cooperbench.com](https://cooperbench.com)
- **Task images**: `akhatua/cooperbench-<repo>:task<id>` on Docker Hub, multi-arch (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)

## Patches: what each one is for

Each task is one real pull request split into N independent features. The eval never merges gold patches — it tests **an agent's** patch (or the merge of two agents' patches) against each feature's hidden tests. The three patch files mean different things:

| file | what it is | property it must satisfy |
|---|---|---|
| `feature{N}/feature.patch` | the gold implementation of feature N **alone** | passes `feature{N}/tests.patch` on the base commit |
| `feature{N}/tests.patch` | feature N's hidden tests | **fails** on the untouched base commit |
| `combined.patch` | the whole PR — every feature landed in one tree, conflicts already resolved | passes **every** feature's `tests.patch` |

**Gold patches for two different features are not meant to be merged.** They were carved out of the same PR and edit the same files, so `git merge` of `feature1.patch` and `feature2.patch` conflicts for 499 of the 652 pairs (see `gold_conflict_report.json`). That is the coordination challenge the benchmark measures, not a defect: two agents each implementing one feature must produce patches that *do* merge. The resolved oracle for any pair is `combined.patch` — it contains both features and passes both test suites.

All three properties are verified for all 199 features on both architectures with the harness's `scripts/check_gradeable.py` and `scripts/check_combined.py`; every fix and its reasoning is logged in [`SPEC_AUDIT.md`](SPEC_AUDIT.md).

## Subsets

Pre-defined task subsets are available in `subsets/` for quick evaluation:

| Subset | Tasks | Pairs | Repos | Description |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `flash` | 20 | 50 | 11 | Dev subset for rapid iteration (sampled from lite) |
| `lite` | 26 | 100 | 12 | Quick evaluation subset |

Both subsets are generated via **uniform pair-level sampling**:

```python
random.seed(42)  # fixed seed for reproducibility

# Generate all possible feature pairs from dataset
all_pairs = []
for task in all_tasks:
    for f1, f2 in combinations(task.features, 2):
        all_pairs.append((task.repo, task.task_id, [f1, f2]))

# Sample 100 pairs uniformly
sampled_pairs = random.sample(all_pairs, 100)
# Result: 23 tasks, 100 pairs, 11 repos
```

Each task in the subset includes a `pairs` field specifying exactly which feature pairs are included:

```json
{
  "repo": "pallets_jinja_task",
  "task_id": 1621,
  "pairs": [[1, 6], [2, 9], [3, 4], ...]
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cooperbench run --subset lite --setting coop
```

## Usage

Each task represents a pull request that was split into multiple independent features. Agents are assigned features to implement, and their outputs are evaluated for correctness and merge compatibility.

See the main CooperBench documentation for details on running experiments.
